Personal project. This is a basic bot for lineage II. This bot works by reading selected areas of the L2 screen and getting the hp, mp, cp of the player and enemy using my own very simple image recognition algorithm. The bot sends keystrokes to the L2.exe process simulating a key pressed by a real player.
